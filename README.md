Traffic Accident Analysis – Task 04

Overview:
Analyzed a large traffic accident dataset to uncover hidden patterns in road conditions, weather, and time of day. Used visualizations and risk analysis to reveal accident hotspots and contributing factors.

Highlights & Insights:

🌦 Weather & Road Conditions: Identified the most dangerous combinations causing accidents.

⏰ Peak Hours: Pinpointed the hours with the highest accident frequency.

💡 Lighting Conditions: Observed the impact of day vs night on accident severity.

🚗 Crash Type & Severity: Analyzed which crash types lead to most injuries.

🔥 Top Risk Factor Combos: Multi-dimensional analysis of weather + road + lighting.

Visualizations:

Heatmaps of time vs weather and injury severity vs hour

Bar charts for crash types and total injuries

Count plots for roadway surface & lighting conditions

Top 10 high-risk factor combinations
